# Advent of code 2020
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2020) using Java. 

I have tried to solve them using streams and lambdas whenever possible and they are definitely not the [best|shortest|quickest|most efficient|most elegant|cleanest] solutions

For convenience, I have kept all support objects in the puzzle class file but they should be organised appropriately
